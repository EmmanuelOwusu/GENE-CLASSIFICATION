# GENE-CLASSIFICATION
This is an in class kaggle competition in Kernel Method for Machine Learning


# INTRODUCTION

Transcription factors (TFs) are regulatory proteins that bind specific sequence motifs in the genome to activate or repress transcription of target genes.
Genome-wide protein-DNA binding maps can be profiled using some experimental techniques and thus all genomics can be classified into two classes for a TF of interest: bound or unbound.

The main task of this project is to classify gene sequence: thus
predicting whether a DNA sequence region is binding site to a specific
transcription factor.

# DATA SET

The data is of two form: the principal files and the optional files.

The principal files contain data that has 2000 training points and
1000 test sequence.
